Starting a project with an analysis plan can be a difficult process, requiring more time and effort to produce than a project without one. In some cases, if done improperly, it may narrow the potential scope of the research if you are unable to branch off the plan. 

On the other hand, starting your project by first implementing an analysis plan provides a structure and direction to create a more straightforward path. This structure allows for clear documentation as the project prgoresses making reproducibility and replicabilty more feasible. If possible, a plan like this is usually a net-positive to the research process, and the overall scientific community.
