I enjoyed this analysis as it felt like a continuation of some work I have done in different GIS classes on gerrymandering. This project involved testing three methods of shape-based compactness scores then assessing the representativeness of districts based on prior presidential elections and race. The work generally showed that compactness measures based on shape, convex hull, and minimum bounding circle generally correlate positively. This was not the case for every district but a general increase in representation was linked to a decrease in compactness for two of the models while the third had a smaller, positive slope with greater variation.

Being my first time trying to create a full, reproducible repository, made the process not entirely smooth. There were times where I would forget to document something in the data index, or miss a section of the analysis plan almost entirely. By the time I pulled it all together, however, it was clear how much of a difference this would make if someone were trying to reproduce something of mine. My missteps in coding and in documenting my work set me up for more success in the repositories and reproductions that followed.
