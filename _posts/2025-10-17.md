Ensuring reproducibility and replicability (R&R) in geography, although difficult, is worth striving for. The book 'Reproducibility and Replicability' speaks of the tensions that may arise in research when safer, more replicable studies and higher-risk, discovery research. It is reasonable to say there is value in both as long as there is balance. In geography, R&R may be more difficult as research involves varied spatial and temporal differences. The uniqueness of people and place at various scales makes each study a different task. Aligning the methods, data collection, and results is difficuly, however there are ways to do so. Maintaining well documented and open source data and methods, like we plan to do in the upcoming semester, can ensure that research is valid, as well as explorative.
