Ensuring reproducibility and replicability (R&R) in geography, although difficult, is worth striving for. The book 'Reproducibility and Replicability' speaks of the tensions that may arise in research when safer, more replicable studies and higher-risk, discovery research. It is reasonable to say there is value in both as long as there is balance. In geography, R&R may be more difficult as research involves varied spatial and temporal differences. The uniqueness of people and place at various scales makes each study a different task. Aligning the methods, data collection, and results is difficuly, however there are ways to do so. Maintaining well documented and open source data and methods, like we plan to do in the upcoming semester, can ensure that research is valid, as well as explorative.

Starting a project with an analysis plan can be a difficult process, requiring more time and effort to produce than a project without one. In some cases, if done improperly, it may narrow the potential scope of the research if you are unable to branch off the plan. 

On the other hand, starting your project by first implementing an analysis plan provides a structure and direction to create a more straightforward path. This structure allows for clear documentation as the project prgoresses making reproducibility and replicabilty more feasible. If possible, a plan like this is usually a net-positive to the research process, and the overall scientific community.

Much of my geographic work at Middlebury has involved pre-determined assignments and workflows so although I have thought about the required steps, it has often felt secondary to the end product. My lack of documentation was made up for by the professor's outlines, so when I did my first truly independent geographic project, I was ill-prepared to create a reproducible version. In the moment, I was not thinking about how someone might be able to transform data in the same way, understand my various assumptions, etc. Only as we have discussed the importance and practicality of reproducible repositories and methodologies have I realized how much it would have improved the validity of my independent senior project.

It's come to light for me this semester that this is not just an undergrad issue, researchers all over academia fail to properly document their work in a reproducible fashion.
