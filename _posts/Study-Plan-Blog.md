Dermot and I have attempted to recreate (and possibly improve upon) Yunliag Meng's (2021) study 'Crime rates and contextual characteristics: a case study in Connecticut, USA.' The study attempts to uncover the relationship between various demographic variables and crime statistics. The reproduction required significant data wrangling and transformation, in addition to uncovering the methods of analysis that were left unclear in the published paper. 

Despite these challenges, we were inclined to dive deeper into this study because of the problematic nature of geographical analysis of crime, in the Meng study in particular. Our reproductionn attempted to critique their choices of analysis. For starters, their use of the Shannon Index - an ecological species diversity measure - as a use for human diversity and how this impacts crime rates was especially problematic. Additionally, their statistical analysis may have involved overfitting which led to incorrect assumptions. The paper has an interesting set up but the execution can be improved upon.
